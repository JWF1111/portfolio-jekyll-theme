# Josh's Porfolio

# About me
Hello! My name is Josh and for the last 6 months, I have been journeying further into the exciting world of analytics. I am a London-based First-Class Business Management and Entrepreneurship graduate with a passion for high performance, coming up with creative solutions to solve problems and enjoy building positive relationships with individuals of all backgrounds. My experience with data and business analytics, both through education and from direct work experience, has given me insight into approaches to analytics, strategy and driving growth for various types and sizes of businesses. I have previously been involved in tech, climate, as well as more recently in ticketing, and am looking to launch my career as a data analyst! I am currently working on a project with Airbnb data where I am investigating a large dataset and extracting insights to better understand how hosts can optimise their offerings. I will share this on here upon completion. I am someone who loves music, as a part-time DJ on the side and pushing myself mentally and physically through immersing myself in disciplines like kickboxing and generally keeping active. I am also fasciated about how we can improve the state of our planet through more sustainable practices in all aspects of life.
